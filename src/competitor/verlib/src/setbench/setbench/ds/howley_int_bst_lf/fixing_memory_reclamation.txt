	x NONE -> x MARK
	x NONE -> new RELOCATE [same new RELOCATE for both replace->op and dest->op]
help relocate
	x RELOCATE -> x NONE
	x RELOCATE -> x MARK
help marked
	x NONE -> new CHILDCAS


do we read fields on MARK and NONE?
if not, we can free when things go from CHILDCAS to NONE, or from RELOCATE to NONE or MARK.
(but, beware of multiple nodes pointing to the same RELOCATE operation!)

helpRelocate(currOp, pred, predOp, curr)
	dereferences currOp
	but not predOp
	currOp is RELOCATE

helpChildCAS(currOp, curr)
	dereferences currOp
	currOp is CHILDCAS

helpMarked(pred, predOp, curr)
	does NOT dereference predOp

it would appear NONE and MARK tagged operation objects are never dereferenced.

immediately free new childcas or relocate if we fail the CAS that is supposed to first make them reachable.
otherwise:
retire() CHILDCAS just after line 94 iff the CAS succeeds.
retire() RELOCATE just after line 112.
